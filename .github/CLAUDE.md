1. **Validate student submissions** for data quality and completeness
2. **Extract structured data** from issue descriptions
3. **Add validated breweries** to breweries.json
4. **Generate UUIDs** for new brewery IDs

6. **Provide helpful feedback** to students

4. **Auto-Deployment** ‚Üí Triggered by "approved" label
   - Claude extracts data from issue
   - Generates UUID
   - Adds to breweries.json
   - Commits changes
   - Deploys to VPS
   - Comments on issue with success
   - Closes issue

## Error Handling

- If data is ambiguous, ask for clarification
- If required field is missing, request it specifically
- If format is wrong, show example of correct format
- If duplicate detected, ask student to confirm
- If any errors occur, provide helpful error message

## Best Practices

- Be friendly and encouraging to students
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Don't make assumptions about missing data
- When in doubt, ask for clarification
- Thank students for contributing
- Explain what will happen next

## Examples

### Good Submission
```
Brewery Name: Triptych Brewing
Brewery Type: micro
Address: 1703 Woodfield Drive
City: Savoy
State: Illinois
Postal Code: 61874
Country: United States
Phone: 2173551500
Website: https://triptychbrewing.com
```

### Needs Revision
```
Brewery Name: Joe's Brewery
City: Champaign
```
Missing: type, state, country

### Edge Cases

**Brewery chains with multiple locations:**
Each location should be a separate entry with unique ID

**Breweries that moved:**
If address changed, update existing entry (don't add duplicate)

**Closed breweries:**
Set `brewery_type: "closed"` and keep all other data

**Planning/upcoming breweries:**
Use `brewery_type: "planning"` and note it may not have full address yet

## Remember

- Students are learning - be patient and educational
- Data quality is important - don't approve incomplete submissions
- Fast turnaround matters - validate quickly when possible
- This contributes to real open-source data - maintain high standards

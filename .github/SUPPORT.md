| Closed issue | Successfully deployed | Your brewery is live! |

### Timeline Expectations

1. **Validation:** Instant (within 30 seconds)
2. **Instructor review:** 24-48 hours (business days only)

### Issue: "Validation Failed" - Invalid Brewery Type

**Problem:** The brewery type you entered isn't recognized.

**Valid types:**
- `micro` - Small craft brewery (most common)
- `nano` - Very small brewery
- `regional` - Regional brewery
- `brewpub` - Brewery with restaurant
- `large` - Major commercial brewery
- `planning` - Not yet open
- `bar` - Bar (doesn't brew)
- `contract` - Contracts brewing to another brewery
- `proprietor` - Operates under another's license
- `closed` - Permanently closed

**Solution:** Edit your issue and use one of the exact types above (lowercase).

---

### Issue: Multiple Validation Comments

**Problem:** You see 2+ identical validation comments on your issue.

**Cause:** This was a bug that has been fixed. Old issues may still show duplicates.

**What to do:** Ignore the duplicates - look at the most recent validation comment and the labels on your issue.

---

### Issue: Phone Number Format Error

**Problem:** Phone number rejected as invalid.

**Requirements:**
- At least 10 digits
- Numbers only (no spaces, dashes, parentheses, or +)
- International format OK if 10+ digits

**Examples:**
```
‚ùå BAD:
(217) 355-1500
217-355-1500
+1-217-355-1500

‚úÖ GOOD:
2173551500
12173551500
```

---

### Issue: Website URL Format Error

**Problem:** Website URL rejected as invalid.

**Requirements:**
- Must start with `http://` or `https://`
- Must be a complete URL

**Examples:**
```
‚ùå BAD:
triptychbrewing.com
www.triptychbrewing.com

‚úÖ GOOD:
https://triptychbrewing.com
http://www.triptychbrewing.com
```

---

### Issue: "Possible Duplicate Detected"

**Problem:** A brewery with similar name/location already exists.

**What to check:**
1. Search the API: `http://178.156.206.171:8000/breweries/search?query=BREWERY_NAME`
2. Compare locations - same city and state?
3. Check if it's actually the same brewery

**If it's the same brewery:**
- Close your issue (no action needed)
- If information is wrong, open an "Update Brewery" issue instead

**If it's different:**
- Reply to the issue explaining the difference
- Examples: "Different location - this one is in Savoy, not Champaign" or "This is their second taproom location"

---

### Issue: I Made a Mistake - How Do I Fix It?

**Before approval:**
1. Click "Edit" on your issue description
2. Make corrections
3. Save - validation will run again automatically

**After approval (issue closed):**
1. Open a **new** issue using the "Update Brewery Information" template
2. Reference your original issue number
3. Explain what needs to be corrected

**Don't reopen closed issues** - create new ones for corrections.

### Issue: My Brewery Isn't Showing in API

**Check these steps:**

1. **Is your issue closed?** If not, it hasn't been deployed yet.
2. **Check labels:** Look for `approved` label = deployed
3. **Wait 1-2 minutes** after deployment comment
4. **Try searching:** `http://178.156.206.171:8000/breweries/search?query=EXACT_NAME`
5. **Check spelling:** API search is case-insensitive but spelling must match

**Still not working?**
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Try the direct API docs: http://178.156.206.171:8000/docs
- Check the deployment comment for the direct brewery link

---

### Issue: Validation Passed but Nothing Happened

**This is normal!** Here's what happens:

1. ‚úÖ **Validation passed** = Automated checks complete
2. ‚è≥ **Waiting...** = Instructor needs to manually review
3. üéØ **Approved label added** = Instructor approved (you might not see this happen)
4. üöÄ **Deployment** = Automatic within 30 seconds
5. ‚úÖ **Closed + Comment** = Your brewery is live!

**Timeline:** Steps 2-5 typically take 24-48 business hours.

**What you can do:**
- Nothing! Just wait for instructor review
- Check back in 1-2 days
- Look for the `approved` label

# Get by ID
http://178.156.206.171:8000/breweries/UUID

```

### API Pagination Guide

**Default limit:** All queries return **50 results** by default.

**Working with large result sets:**

```bash
# Default: returns only 50 breweries
http://178.156.206.171:8000/breweries?by_state=California

# Increase to maximum: 200 results per page
http://178.156.206.171:8000/breweries?by_state=California&per_page=200

# Get next page (results 201-400)
http://178.156.206.171:8000/breweries?by_state=California&per_page=200&page=2
```

**Getting total counts without limits:**

```bash
# Returns {"total": 523} - shows count without pagination
http://178.156.206.171:8000/breweries/meta?by_state=California
```

**Example: Getting all breweries from a state with 500+ entries**

```python
import requests

# Step 1: Get total count
meta = requests.get("http://178.156.206.171:8000/breweries/meta?by_state=California")
total = meta.json()["total"]
print(f"Total breweries: {total}")

# Step 2: Calculate pages needed (200 per page)
pages = (total + 199) // 200

# Step 3: Loop through all pages
all_breweries = []
for page in range(1, pages + 1):
    response = requests.get(
        f"http://178.156.206.171:8000/breweries?by_state=California&per_page=200&page={page}"
    )
    all_breweries.extend(response.json())

print(f"Retrieved {len(all_breweries)} breweries")
```

**Limits by endpoint:**

| Endpoint | Default | Maximum |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `/breweries` | 50 | 200 per page |
| `/breweries/search` | 50 | 200 per page |

| `/breweries/autocomplete` | 15 | 15 (fixed) |
